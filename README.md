# bionicsmanager
Manage your Rimworld bionics with a user-friendly GUI.

Please make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed on your computer. Older versions might work but no guarantees. 
I am fairly certain no libraries outside of the standard python modules are used but please correct me if I am wrong.
Simply run main.py with python to start the GUI.

Alternatively you can use an executable file that I've converted using auto-py-to-exe, provided you trust me.
There is a download link in the releases. Unzip it using 7zip or winrar and run main.exe.

If you have any issues you can contact me any time on my reddit account. https://www.reddit.com/user/LintyCarcass
All changes are automatically saved, you can close the program at any time without losing progress.
The progress bar takes into account bionics that can be installed twice on a pawn.

If you have any suggestions/bugfixes please pull request them.
