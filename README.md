# bionicsmanager
Manage your Rimworld bionics with a user-friendly GUI.

Please make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed on your computer. Alternatively you can use an executable from auto-py-gui if I've bothered creating one.
If you're not using an executable version, simply run main.py with python to start the GUI.

All changes are automatically saved, you can close the program at any time without losing progress.
The progress bar takes into account the bionics that can be installed twice on a pawn.

If you have any suggestions/bugfixes please pull request them.
